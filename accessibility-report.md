# **Accessibility Report**



## 1. Equitable Use
Our program facilitates users of all abilities through easy 
navigation and buttons that are clearly labeled. For instance,
our main menu has clear and visually  buttons for "Start", 
"Battle", "History" "Levels", and "Upload" , they guarantee all
users have easy access to the main features. In the future, 
additional features could include a screen reader for visually 
impaired users or keyboard shortcuts for people who unable to 
operate a mouse.

## 2. Flexibility in Use
When we designed our game, we coded it in such a way that we
need access to the W,A,S,D buttons and the user needs a mouse.
Although we cannot fully comply with this principle at the moment,
we will comply with this principle in the future by adding features such as button customization for users

## 3. Simple and Intuitive Use
Thanks to the game design we have created,
even those who try the game for the first time 
can use it without any difficulty. 
All buttons have their functions written in big 
letters and give instant feedback. 
Although it seems to fit this principle very well, 
if we can add a tutorial part in the future,
it can be a simpler use for all player masses.

## 4. Perceptible Information
For now, we have only used one color and design GUI in our 
game, but in the future we will add a “night mode” or
“dark mode” to make it more accessible to users in different
conditions.
## 5. Tolerance for Error
Our program has few confirmation dialogs for potentially 
disruptive actions like exiting a level or navigating away 
from a page. In the future updates, we will implement an undo 
button or a reset button to further safeguard against user
errors.

## 6. Low Physical Effort
In our game, we have used large and understandable
buttons so that players can move from one menu to another
in the shortest possible time. In future developments, we 
will use a touchscreen joypad to replace the mouse.

## 7. Size and Space for Approach and Use
The program is designed with large sized buttons 
and large spaces, in this way we minimize accidental clicks. 
Game layout is resizable to fit different screen dimensions, 
in this way all different platform users can access our game
in the same way.

# **Marketing Audience**
Our target audience is students, puzzle lovers and casual gamers.
Our project appeals to users who want to challenge themselves.
They can do this by designing their own sections and set their own difficulty levels.
And finally, fans of classic Tetris can enjoy a more
advanced version of their favorite game.

# Demographic Considerations
Although our game is aimed at a general audience, the program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. The interface of our game has only one color button and the Tetris part has only one color shapes. There are users who are sensitive to these colors or colourblind people who have a hard time distinguishing them.
Also “Normal” mode appeals more to the general audience, but “Upload Photo” mode appeals to a smaller audience, because some users may not know how to upload or may find it difficult to play the game after uploading the picture. This is why our game is less likely to be used by older people and colorblind people.
